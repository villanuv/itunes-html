Main interface extended with ratings. Playlist header added with name editing and shuffle play. Also new: scrobbling, view dropdown and context menus, playing icons, Spotlight section.

### Not iTunes v0.52

New Notifications area. Main interface extended with more data. Added status bar with playlist count and upload times. Top bar with Playlist, Controls and Date dropdowns. More icons.

### Not iTunes v0.51

YouTube Player and Search API integrated to replace the previously used Rdio. Configured close to the newer MacOS UI with dock and relevant "apps" - with static playlists included for temporary purposes. Virtual mail included for contact. New version renamed "Not iTunes" from "iTunes HTML" and launched under dj.WYSIWYG brand. 

### Prior to v0.5

First iteration of Rdio Player and virtual Mac interface, based off a related Belly Engineering exercise. Used Rdio's old web player, and broke once their service shut down permanently.
