# Not iTunes

## Notes

### Not iTunes v0.51

YouTube Player and Search API integrated to replace the previously used Rdio. Configured close to the newer MacOS UI with dock and relevant "apps" - with static playlists included for temporary purposes. Virtual mail included for contact. New version renamed "Not iTunes" from "iTunes HTML" and launched under dj.WYSIWYG brand. 

### Prior to v0.5

First iteration of Rdio Player and virtual Mac interface, based off a related Belly Engineering exercise. Used Rdio's old web player, and broke once their service shut down permanently.
