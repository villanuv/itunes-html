## Notes

First iteration of Rdio Player and virtual Mac interface. This uses Rdio's old web player, ~~and needs to be updated for the new JavaScript API and player. As they've deprecated OAuth 1.0, search functionality is broken.~~

As Rdio has long shuttered, this app no longer functions as it used to. It was a great exercise in Angular, UI CSS design and jQuery functionality.
